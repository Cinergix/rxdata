# typescript-module-starter

A bare minimum starter repository for client side npm modules written in typescript. Includes `prettier` for linting, `karma` and `jasmine` for unit tests and `istanbul` for coverage. Uses `webpack` to transpile typescript when running tests. To get started, clone this repository and run npm install.
